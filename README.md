What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The primary problem was to design and implement a program that could efficiently manage course data, including course numbers, titles, and prerequisites, and provide functionality to load, list, and retrieve course information. This involved choosing the most suitable data structure for efficient data handling.   

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

The approach involved designing pseudocode for different data structures (Vector, Hash Table, Binary Search Tree) to handle course data.   
Each data structure's efficiency in terms of runtime for operations like searching, insertion, and sorting was analyzed.   
Data structures are crucial because they significantly impact program performance and the ability to manage data effectively. Understanding their properties allows for choosing the right structure to optimize specific operations (e.g., searching, sorting).   

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

The files primarily focus on the design and analysis phase, outlining pseudocode and runtime analysis. Roadblocks in implementation (as seen in "ProjectTwo.cpp") were addressed through error handling (e.g., invalid file format, duplicate course numbers) and input validation (ProjectTwo.cpp).   
Pseudocode validation for prerequisite existence was a key challenge, addressed by different search strategies in different data structures.   

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

The project emphasized the importance of up-front design with pseudocode, focusing on data structure selection as a critical design decision.   
It highlighted the need to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms and data structures to create efficient software.   
"ProjectTwo.cpp" demonstrates practical application by using a map for efficient course lookup, showing a shift towards optimized implementations.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The use of modular functions (loadCourseData, printCourseList, printCourseInformation) in "ProjectTwo.cpp" promotes maintainability and readability (AssignmentSixProject.pdf).
The Course class encapsulates data, improving organization and adaptability (AssignmentSixProject.pdf).
The pseudocode in "AssignmentxSixProject.pdf" serves as documentation, enhancing understanding and future modifications.   
Error handling and input validation in "ProjectTwo.cpp" contribute to robustness and adaptability to unexpected inputs (AssignmentSixProject.pdf; ProjectTwo.cpp).
